# FlowQ Phase O: End-to-End System Validation & Final Integration Report

## Executive Summary
This document presents the complete, empirical verification of the Quantum-Enhanced Adaptive Urban Traffic Optimization system across all subsystems implemented in Phases A through N. Validation confirms strict cross-boundary contract adherence, absolute signal safety invariants, multi-layer precedence rules, and reproducible optimization performance.

## 2. Signal Safety & Invariant Compliance
- **Zero Conflicting Greens**: Enforced by disjoint 2-phase green movements (Phase 0: North/South vs Phase 2: East/West).
- **Clearance Intervals Preserved**: Fixed 4.0s yellow and 2.0s all-red intervals are guaranteed in TraCI and web controllers.
- **Bounded Green Allocations**: Strictly bounded within $[22\text{s}, 42\text{s}]$ ($C \in [52\text{s}, 92\text{s}]$); negative or zero timings are mathematically prohibited.
- **Anti-Oscillation Protection**: 15.0s damping window prevents erratic timing thrashing during transient demand spikes.
- **Precedence Hierarchy Compliance**: Verified strict priority ordering:
  $$\text{Safety Clearance} \succ \text{Emergency Corridor Priority} \succ \text{Dynamic Event Adaptation} \succ \text{Normal QUBO / QAOA}$$

## 4. Scientific Limitations & Boundaries
- **Simulation vs Real-World**: Dynamic vehicle kinematics were evaluated using Eclipse SUMO 1.27.1 and calibrated simulation proxies; results must not be characterized as municipal field data.
- **Quantum Simulator**: QAOA was executed on classical statevector simulation (`AerSimulator`) and classical COBYLA optimization; real quantum processors would exhibit gate infidelities and readout noise.
- **Deployment Boundary**: Prototype signal timings are recommendations for simulation and engineering analysis; they do not directly actuate physical traffic controller hardware.
