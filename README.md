**FlowQ** is an end-to-end, hybrid classical-quantum intelligent transportation management platform. It integrates microscopic traffic simulation, computer vision micro-perception, mathematical signal optimization, and quantum algorithmic research to address urban gridlock, emergency transit delays, and vehicular emissions. By casting signal timing as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and mapping it to an Ising spin Hamiltonian, FlowQ evaluates exact classical baselines alongside the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on simulated quantum circuits—all governed by a non-negotiable, safety-critical preemption hierarchy.

## Key Features

1. **Micro-Perception & Queue Estimation**: Ultralytics YOLOv8 vehicle detection coupled with centroid Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), ray-casting approach Region-of-Interest (ROI) classification, and velocity-based stopped queue estimation ($v < 0.5\text{ m/s}$).
2. **Canonical Data Contract**: A single, immutable, validated `TrafficObservation` JSON schema shared seamlessly across simulation, perception, optimization, and visualization modules.
3. **Exact QUBO & QAOA Optimization**: Formulates signal phase allocations over discrete candidate green durations ($22\text{s}, 30\text{s}, 40\text{s}$) with delay, queue imbalance, and cycle duration penalties. Solved via exact classical state-space search ($0.85\text{ ms}$) and QAOA on Qiskit quantum simulators ($93.33\%$ recovery of exact classical optimum).
4. **Multi-Intersection Network Orchestration**: Coordinates arterial networks across 4 to 8+ connected intersections with observation freshness enforcement ($30\text{s}$ window) and anti-oscillation damping ($15\text{s}$).
5. **Emergency Green Corridor Preemption**: Ingests emergency vehicle priority requests, establishes arterial green waves along multi-junction routes, provides progressive junction release upon traversal, and restores normal QUBO control cleanly (saving $93.3\text{s}$ over baseline transit delay).
6. **Dynamic Incident Adaptation**: Ingests real-world traffic perturbations (accidents, road closures, traffic demand surges, pedestrian crossings) and adapts effective road states while strictly obeying the supervisory precedence hierarchy:
   $$\text{Signal Safety Clearance} \succ \text{Emergency Priority} \succ \text{Dynamic Event Adaptation} \succ \text{Normal QUBO / QAOA}$$
7. **Environmental Sustainability Metrics**: Evaluates vehicular delay, throughput, fuel consumption ($0.00025\text{ L/s}$ idle), and stoichiometric $\text{CO}_2$ emissions ($2,392\text{ g CO}_2 / \text{L}$).
8. **Interactive Digital Twin Dashboard**: High-performance Node.js / HTML5 dark glassmorphic command dashboard featuring 2D traffic canvas, live signal states, junction inspection, and dedicated research panels.
9. **Real-World Prototype Vision Interface**: Ingests camera feeds, local video, or RTSP streams, executes perception, and produces prototype signal recommendations with automated credential masking.

### Key Findings
- **QAOA Ground-Truth Recovery**: Across 240 optimization runs, QAOA achieved an overall exact classical optimum recovery rate of **$93.33\%$** ($100\%$ in Low traffic, $92.5\%$ in Normal, $87.5\%$ in High) with $100\%$ feasible solutions.
- **Emergency Priority**: Emergency green wave preemption along route `J1 -> J2 -> J3 -> J4` reduced ambulance travel time from $153.3\text{s}$ to $60.0\text{s}$ (**$93.3\text{s}$ saved**).
- **Incident Recovery**: Dynamic event injection safely adapted signal splits to clear incident queues during a 65% capacity reduction.

## Known Research Limitations

1. **Simulation Environment**: All vehicle dynamics are simulated in Eclipse SUMO and synthetic browser proxies; results reflect modeled kinematics and should not be cited as municipal field data.
2. **Quantum Backend**: QAOA was executed on classical statevector simulation (`AerSimulator`) rather than physical QPUs. Quantum decoherence and gate errors were not present.
3. **Advisory Prototype Scope**: The real-world vision interface produces advisory recommendations and does not actuate physical traffic-light cabinet hardware.
